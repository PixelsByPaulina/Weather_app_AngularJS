https://paulinadesign.github.io/Weather_app_AngularJS/app/index.html

Get the weather info of your current location or type the city or country yourself. You can press the "search" button or just press enter to submit the city.
The app also shows the forecast for the next 5 days.

*Location by your coordinates finder only works if you open this app locally on your computer.
You can use Browser Sync to host it using commands:
    npm install -g browser-sync (if you don't have it installed)
    browser-sync start --server "app" --files "index.html"
http://localhost:3002/
